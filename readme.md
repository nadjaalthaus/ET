EYE TRACKING DATA PREPROCESSING FOR GROWTH CURVE ANALYSIS 

(C) Nadja Althaus

These scripts were developed for the eye tracking time course analysis (multi-level models/growth curve)
presented in **Althaus, Kotzor, Schuster & Lahiri (2022)**. Distinct orthography boosts morphophonological discrimination: 
Vowel raising in Bengali verb inflections. *Cognition, 222*, 104963.  
They are intended for "sample report" exports from EyeLink/DataViewer.  Exported files need to be placed in subdirectory ./Data.
